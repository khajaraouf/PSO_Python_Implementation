# Particle Swarm Optimization

This code is about Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) which is hinted at by bird flocking and fish schooling. The algorithm of PSO is simple. Particles are a number of simple entities in a search space. We create a population of particles and measure their individual fitness with an objective function of the problem. Particles are then moved from their current to the next position based on their personal best location, and on the swarmâ€™s best location so far. By iterating the moves the swarm gradually reaches an optimal point of the objective function over generations.
